# Send Visit* Data Directly to predict.io (iOS Only)

> **NOTE** *Visit data means data generated solely by the [iOS Visit API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clvisit), you must be sure that the data you capture and send to this endpoint *actually* originates from there.

You can send data directly to us at predict.io, skipping the requirement for installing our SDK for iOS & Android in your apps.

This solution can be useful if you already are capturing visit or location information from your users and would prefer sending it directly from your own servers rather than integrating an SDK to capture the same data you already are receiving.

## Authentication

1. Register for a [predict.io API key](http://www.predict.io/service/registration/?level=1)
1. Set `Authorization` header to `Token token=<YOUR API KEY>`
1. Test sending data to your sandbox account (check response codes)

## Sending Data

Data should be sent to **`https://api.parktag.mobi/v4/visits`** and follow the structure defined in the [example JSON](#example-json)

### Testing Sandbox

You should receive (or be given) a sandbox API key for testing, you can check that your integration is receiving successful response codes and you can use our support to verify sandbox data we receive.

### Response Codes

Our API should only (deliberately) return these response codes, anything other than these may indicate a fault on our side and the request should be retried:

* `200 / Success` – The request was successfully processed
* `400 / Bad Request` - The request is malformed someway and can't be processed
* `401 / Unauthorized` - Your API key is invalid

## Support

Visit our Help Center, open an Issue or send an email to support@predict.io.

## How to Collect Visit Data? (iOS Only)

Visit data is collected using the [iOS Visit API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clvisit), which is _background_ location functionality of [`CoreLocation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation). You must take the necessary steps to make sure that you have the required permissions in your app to ['Request Always Authorization'](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/choosing_the_authorization_level_for_location_services/requesting_always_authorization).

With that you can follow Apple's documentation on ['Using the Visits Location Service'](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/getting_the_user_s_location/using_the_visits_location_service) and with that data transform it into the JSON structure documented above.

> **NOTE** A `CLVisit` whose `arrivalDate` is `distantPast` or `departureDate` is `distantFuture` should **be ignored.**
